During my sophomore semester, my design class had us come up with a solution to a problem, or improve on an already existing solution. My group decided to improve upon the process of water bottle cleaning, particulary in the aspect of the water bottle brush.

<p>Looking at typical existing water bottle brushes on the market, the majority looked something like this: </p>

Now the brush works as intended, since why else would there be some many of this design on the market, but using it would require a twisting motion of the forearm and, depending on the depth of the bottle, some up and down pushing effort from the user. We decided that we could make things more efficient and more ergonomic. Why not create a brush with multiple sizes for different bottles, and have it work by spinning a handle on the top? That way, it would eliminate a lot of the back and forth motion on the arm, and there would be no more need to twist and turn and huff and puff just to get rid of some gunk on the deep corner of the bottle.

After some initial design drafting, followed by a scrappy prototype, we finally ended up with our first completed working design.

Here are the rendered images created through Fusion 360:

Here are the physical parts 3D printed and assembled, with the internal gears purchased from McMaster:
