As a final project for my junior year fluids class, me, alongside four others, were tasked with dissecting a gas powered air blower and analyzing the fluid mechanics behind the system.

For my part, I focused on the calculations of the centrifugal pump design. I researched the governing equations and concepts such as the archimedean spiral shape of the volute of the centrifugal pumps within the engine of the machine. I also participated in taking apart the blower piece by piece and documenting the process with photos as well as relevant dimensions that we would need in our calculations of fluid flow.

Here is the end result <a href="https://youtu.be/nHKT9W6F7zo?si=qYHqMJ9qmT8r9OKO">video</a>.
